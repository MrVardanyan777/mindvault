Hi everyone, welcome to my new project. 

## About the Project

*MindVault*  This is a note-taking app that I designed and developed. To start using the app, users must sign in using their Google account. They can add, edit, and delete notes. The app includes a rich text editor called react-quill for editing and adding notes. All data is saved in MongoDB, and all API requests are handled by the power of Next.js 13.  

This will be the initial version of the app. In the future, I plan to introduce exciting new features like note organization through folders, the use of tags, and more. Currently, as a showcase app, I'd describe it as functional but not exceptional; it falls somewhere between decent and excellent, leaning toward the positive side.
